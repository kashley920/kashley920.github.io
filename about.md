## About Me
Welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is Ken Ashley, and I am currently a
Mathematics - Computer Science major at University of California, San Diego, with an
expected graduation of Spring 2019. I am employed as a Software Engineering
Intern at Hologic, Inc. On this site you can find detailed information about some
of my past projects and learn more about me and my interests.

I began programming in high school, writing Lua scripts for games and following some online
tutorials. When I took the AP Computer Science class, I realized that I truly enjoyed
studying the subject and decided to make that the focus of my higher education. Since then,
I have expanded my knowledge through numerous college courses and experiences in three
software engineering internships. I plan to pursue a job as a Software Engineer
after my graduation.
