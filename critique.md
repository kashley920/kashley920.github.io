title: Translating Math Into Code
---

## Introduction

This post was inspired by Matt Might's article, __[Translating math into code with examples in Java, Racket, Haskell and Python](http://matt.might.net/articles/discrete-math-and-code/)__.
As a Mathematics - Computer Science major, this is an issue that I deal with
regularly in my classes. Here I will review Matt's suggestions, and give my own
take on how to convert the purely functional language of Math to real applications
in programming.

## Sets
Matt begins by explaining that while all sets in Math are unordered, programmers
often use sorted sets for their operations. In terms of implementation, for the
problem of subsets he suggests utilizing class based inheritance, found in most
object oriented programming languages, to represent the relationships between
super and sub sets.

## Disjoint Union

## Sequences and Vectors

## Functions
