## Introduction

This was a 6 man project developed for the Software Engineering class at UC San Diego. Our goal was to create an Android app following
a customer's specifications. The customer wanted an app that would allow users to reminisce on past times by viewing photos that
remind them of their current time/place as their phone background. They later expanded on this by adding the ability to share photos
with friends and create a form of social network for photo sharing. I will explain these features more in detail below.

## How to Run

Clone the repository into Android Studio to run the app in your choice of emulator or mobile phone.  

We could build an apk of our project, but we decided not to because this was only meant to be a private class project.
